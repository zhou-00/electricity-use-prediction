# Predicting electricity use

This is loosely based on a model that I built for a research project, except that I have replaced confidential proprietary data with a public dataset from UCI, and tuned on fewer parameters. This is a very general, brute-force approach to hyperparameter tuning. But the upside is that you can use it on pretty much any dataset of purely numeric data, although you may want to do some data exploration first so that you can perform the appropriate normalisation / standardisation.
